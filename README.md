# Two-in-One-Low-power-XOR-XNOR-Gate
## Abstract
With the increasing technology, the size of the transistors is
reducing. The reducing size leads to the tradeoff between
power, efficiency and switching time. Because of which
there is requirement to design low power transistor with less
area and lesser number of gates. The design should use
lesser power as well. Thus, making it more and more
efficient.
